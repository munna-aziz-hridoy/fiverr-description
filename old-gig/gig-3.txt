I will develop or fix mern stack, react js and node js websites
Welcome to my gig!



I specialize in using JavaScript & TypeScript to develop Web applications. In addition, I am also proficient in frontend and backend app development with the MERN stack.



My Services:

Single or Multi-page website using React.JS or MERN stack
Develop Backend using Express.JS and Node.JS
The front-end website will use a component-based react js MERN stack-based on Figma.
My responsibilities as a MERN stack developer include developing a real-time node & react js custom website (ERP, point of sale, multi-vendor e-commerce website, etc.) with role-based custom dashboards.
Implementation of payment gateways (Stripe / PayPal) with React.JS websites

Javascript, Typescript
React.JS and necessary dependencies (Axios, react-query, react-router, and more)
CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS)
Component Libraries (Material UI, Ant Design, Daisy UI)
Firebase
Node.JS and Express.JS


(If you have any custom requirements with the tools or technology please feel free to reach)
